We're always on the look out for new volunteers to join our team and help make our critical deliveries and collections. 

### What's involved?
A typical day starts around 9am and could last until around 6pm, though usually you'll be finished much sooner than that. We'll pair you up with an experienced volunteer untill you're comfortable to go it alone. If you don't have a driving license, that won't prevent your from volunteering as our drivers always welcome a second (or third) pair of hands to help with the heavy lifting.

All our volunteers take great satisfaction from supporting the food banks and ultimately helping those most in need.

#### Volunteer to Drive
We need drivers for our long-wheel-base Transit-style vans each week-day. You don't need any special license, but you need to be comfortable driving a vehicle of that size. 

#### Volunteer to Assist
We aim to send each driver with an additional volunteer to support with loading and unloading. Please note that there's a lot of heavy lifting involved. Manual handling safety guidance is provided.

### How often do you need us to help?
We're very flexible - there's no minimum time commitment. Some of our volunteers help once or twice per week, others help on an occasional basis. It's really up to you - we're very grateful for any support you're able to offer. All we ask is that you can commit to a full day when you are able to volunteer.
