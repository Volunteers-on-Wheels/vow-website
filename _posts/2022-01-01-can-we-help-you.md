Volunteers on Wheels has a van available running five days per week. We primarily focus on bulk collections and deliveries on behalf of food banks in and around North London and South Hertfordshire.

If you are a food bank or other charitable organsation, please  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact">get in touch</a> to see how we can help!
