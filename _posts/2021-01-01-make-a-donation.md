There are multiple ways to support our critical work:

## Donate online!
Consider making a donation to Volunteers on Wheels. The charity is entirely run by volunteers - 100% of your donation will go towards supporting our vital work. If you are a UK tax payer, don't forget to opt in for Gift Aid. This means we can claim an additional 25% on top of your donation.
