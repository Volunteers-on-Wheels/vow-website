There are multiple ways to support our critical work - make a donation, fundraise for us or join our team of friendly volunteers!

## Donate online!
Consider making a donation to Volunteers on Wheels. The charity is entirely run by volunteers - 100% of your donation will go towards supporting our vital work. If you are a UK tax payer, don't forget to opt in for Gift Aid. This means we can claim an additional 25% on top of your donation.

<!-- ⏳ We're just getting set up with JustGiving and expect to go live in February 2022. In the mean time, please contact us if you'd like to make a donation. -->
We're currently waiting for our Gift Aid registration to be processed, which should be complete by July 2023. In the mean time, please <a href = "/contact">contact us</a> to make a donation!
