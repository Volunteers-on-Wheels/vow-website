On behalf of the Volunteers on Wheels team, THANK YOU for your generous donation.

Your kind support will contribute to our expansion plans necessary to support more vulnerable people struggling with food poverty and insecurity. We are entirely run by volunteers, meaning that 100% of your donation will go towards supporting our vital front line support important work.

Please take some time to explore our new website, read about <a href = "/about">our important work</a> and learn more about <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/volunteer-with-us/">volunteering with VoW</a>. We are always looking for new volunteers to join our small but growing team!

Thank you for choosing to make a difference with us. Your kindness and generosity will help us to continue to make a real and meaningful impact in the lives of those we serve. 

With deepest appreciation,

**The Volunteers on Wheels team**
