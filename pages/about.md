Started in 2020, we help bridge the gap between supermarkets and food banks. 

Now helping support over 10k people a week, the objects of Volunteers on Wheels are the relief from the consequences of poverty and financial hardship for the public benefit for those primarily living in the UK without discrimination. 

In particular VoW will work to relieve food insecurity, supporting and assisting a wide range of food banks and other charitable (or voluntary) organisations by the transportation of surplus food and other essential care items to/from organisations, groups and individuals for the ultimate benefit for anyone who does not possess the resources to provide for themselves and secondarily to reduce food wastage.
