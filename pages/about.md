Started in 2020, Volunteers on Wheels (VoW) works to redistribute surplus supplies to food banks. We see first-hand that the demand on food banks continues to rise as more and more people look to them for support. We would rather there wasn't a need for food banks, but we're determined to continue to support them to the best of our ability.

### Our Objectives

The objectives of Volunteers on Wheels are to:
* Distribute food to those struggling with food poverty and insecurity.
* Minimise food wastage (through redistribution)
* Create a more efficient logistics operation for food banks by delivering in bulk using larger vehicles. One van can replace at least 12 standard cars.

### Our Story so Far
Volunteers on Wheels was started in 2020 as a response to the first Covid Lockdown. Initially, we delivered prepared meals to several beneficiaries including NHS key workers, hospices and food banks. Over time we shifted our focus to supporting larger bulk deliveries to food banks and have developed a partnership with Morrisons in St Albans.

In February 2022, we organised the contribution of multiple pallets of food and baby supplies to be flown out to Ukranian refugees at the Romanian border. 

We formally registered as a charity in July 2022 and continue our vital work to support those in need.

### Our Success so Far
Since starting in April 2020, we estimate to have distributed over 800 tonnes of food to support the equivalent of 2,500,000 visits to the food banks we support. 

We currently support up to 27,500 people per week - as estimated by our food bank beneficiaries.

In early 2022, we received an award from the Mayor of Barnet Council for Outstanding Community Service.
