We are a charity organization that was founded in 2020 with the mission to redistribute surplus supplies to food banks and help combat food poverty and insecurity. We believe that no one should have to go hungry and we are committed to doing our part to make sure that everyone has access to the essentials they need.

### Our Objectives

Our objectives are simple yet powerful. We work tirelessly to: 
* Distribute food and other supplies to those struggling with food poverty and insecurity.
* Minimise food wastage (through redistribution)
* Create a more efficient logistics operation for food banks by delivering in bulk using larger vehicles. One van can replace at least 12 standard cars.

### Our Story so Far

Our story began in the midst of the first Covid lockdown when we started delivering prepared meals to those in need, including NHS key workers, hospices, and food banks. As we grew and evolved, we shifted our focus to supporting larger bulk deliveries to food banks and formed a partnership with Morrisons in St Albans.

In February 2022, we organized the contribution of multiple pallets of food and baby supplies to be flown out to Ukrainian refugees at the Romanian border. 

We formally registered as a charity in July 2022 and continue our vital work to support those in need.


<!-- Volunteers on Wheels was started in 2020 as a response to the first Covid Lockdown. Initially, we delivered prepared meals to several beneficiaries including NHS key workers, hospices and food banks. Over time we shifted our focus to supporting larger bulk deliveries to food banks and have developed a partnership with Morrisons in St Albans.

In February 2022, we organised the contribution of multiple pallets of food and baby supplies to be flown out to Ukranian refugees at the Romanian border. 

We formally registered as a charity in July 2022 and continue our vital work to support those in need. -->

### Our Success so Far
Since starting in April 2020, we estimate to have distributed over 800 tonnes of food to support the equivalent of 2,500,000 visits to the food banks we support. We currently support up to 27,500 people per week - as estimated by our food bank beneficiaries.

Our efforts have been recognized by the community, and in early 2022, we received an award from the Mayor of Barnet Council for Outstanding Community Service.

We are honored to be able to make a difference in the lives of so many and we will continue to work tirelessly to support those in need. Join us in making a difference, together we can create a brighter future for all.
